**AIDE Distribution Addendum (Plain Language):**

- You are free to use, modify, and build upon AIDE for your own projects, including commercial/professional use, provided you visibly credit "Built with AIDE by platysonique" in your apps, docs, or about screens.
- You may NOT resell, redistribute, repackage, or embed AIDE itself (standalone, as a VSIX, or as a bundled/integrated module/component) as part of another product or platform—commercial or otherwise—without explicit written permission from platysonique.
- If you wish to redistribute, repackage, or embed AIDE (as a product or software component in another system/platform/product), please contact platysonique (via GitHub or project issues) to discuss licensing/partnership.

This addendum expresses the author's intentions for fair, community-first use and may not restrict actions otherwise permitted under the MIT license, but users are asked to respect its spirit.
